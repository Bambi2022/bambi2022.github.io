<i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>My only work experience so far was in the summer of 2019 when worked as a volunteer for the Mesa Public Libary.

(Cap Icon) I'm am currently going to high school and will graduate in 2022. I plan on going to Grand Canyon University and getting my Masters Degree in Cybersecurity. When it comes to programming I am self taught and I am currently taking classes for HTML and Python.

(Code Icon) I enjoy writing code. While I have never published anything I have worked on mods for Terraria and Minecraft. I have also made prototype games in Unreal Engine 4 and Pokemon fan games using RPG Maker XP.

(Heart Icon) I have many hobbies so when I have free time I like to travel, read, program, listen to music, draw, watch tv/movies and talk to my best friend Aaron.

(Document Icon) I do not have any projects publicaly avaiable and if that changes I will up date this section.

(Globe Icon) I grew up in Mesa, Arizona and have lived here my whole life. After college I plan on moveing out of this state.
